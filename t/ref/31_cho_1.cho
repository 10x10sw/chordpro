Swing [D]low, sweet [G]chari[D]ot,
Comin’ for to carry me [A7]home.
Swing [D7]low, sweet [Gxxxxxxxx]chari[D]ot,
Comin’ for to [A7]carry me [D]home.

I [D]looked over Jordan, and [G]what did I [D]see,
     “Comin’ for to carry me [A7]home.”
A [D7]band of angels [G]comin’ after [D]me,
     Comin’ for to [A7]carry me [D]home.     [G]     [D]     [G]

I’m sometimes up and sometimes down,
     Comin’ for to carry me home.
But still my soul feels heavenly bound.
     Comin’ for to carry me home.
